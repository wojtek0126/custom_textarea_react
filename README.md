# custom_textarea_react
Task time! I have seen an issue with client asking dev team to insert component with dot at the start of every new row in textarea. Their dev could not do it. Maybe he already did? I will crerate that kind of component. Textarea itself cannot take tags. But slack textareas, fb textareas etc can. And so the goal is:
create textarea with possibility of injecting components not only text in React.
